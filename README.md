# Land-Records-on-Blockchain
Property records on the blockchain 

This is a project to store Land and Property records on the Blockchain.
Today Land records in developed countries are centralised and can be curropted by a rogue official.
On the other hand developing countries, have no system to store records, And legal papers are the sole means to establish ownership.
These can be spoofed easily.

These techniques introduce Land and Title fraud, and problems like double selling and double mortgage.
A decentralised system can help in secure logging, and easy debt swaps and property transfers.
